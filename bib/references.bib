Sponges (Porifera) are another dominant habitat-forming organism on MCEs (Pomponi et al. 2019). In addition to the large and conspicuous sponges, the diversity of more cryptic, encrusting sponges appears to be very significant on MCEs. The taxonomy of this group is in dire need of additional research in general, which compounds the need for further research on MCE sponges (Pomponi et al. 2019). Foraminifera are another group for which some information is known with respect to MCE communities, but much more is needed (Renema 2019).
Perhaps the most significant taxonomic gap for MCE biodiversity characterizations are the numerous other invertebrate phyla, many of which are extremely diverse among shallow coral reefs, and the same is likely to hold for MCEs as well. In particular, ascidians, crustaceans, mollusks, echinoderms, bryozoans, zoanthids, benthic ctenophores, and various other invertebrate groups appear to be well-represented on MCEs, but little has been done in terms of scientifically documenting these organisms on MCEs. Research has been published for some representatives of these groups (as cited earlier), but mostly in the form of new species descriptions. Yet, the role these organisms play on overall MCE biodiversity is far larger than what the historical publication record reflects.

In addition, the indirect effects of storm waves (i.e., sedimentation and debris slides) have occurred in several mesophotic communities (Harmelin-Vivien and Laboute 1986; Liddell and Avery 2000; Bak et al. 2005; Appeldoorn et al. 2016). Diseases of shallow coral reefs have been reported with increasing frequency (Ruiz-Morenol et al. 2012), and there is some evidence that upper mesophotic reefs can be susceptible to disease (Smith et al. 2010). Likewise, anthropogenic nutrients and toxins have been reported on mesophotic reefs (Lapointe 1997; Etnoyer et al. 2016), and that could result in significant increases in algae (McCook 1999) resulting in competition with corals and sponges at depth (Slattery and Lesser 2014).

This study offered comparable research from Belize and the Florida Keys to demonstrate the broad applicability of these results. Lesser and Slattery (2013) provided further evidence that the observed growth rates at mesophotic depths occurred in the presence of a predator community that was similar to that of shallow coral reefs suggesting that predation processes are not the only control on sponge communities in the Caribbean (Pawlik et al. 2013, 2015; Slattery and Lesser 2015)

            Due to increasing frequency of disturbances to shallow reefs, it has been suggested that Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems (MCEs, 30–150 m depth) may serve as a refuge for corals and a source of larvae that can facilitate the recovery of shallow degraded reefs. As such, they have received increased attention in the past decade, yet remained understudied regarding recruitment dynamics. Here we describe coral recruitment dynamics on settlement tiles and their adjacent natural habitats (10 m vs. 50 m depths) in Eilat, over a period of 5.5 years. The tiles were deployed along three sites onto 18 racks (3 at each depth and at each site). Recruitment patterns varied both temporally and spatially, ending up to two-fold higher juvenile density and higher recruitment rates at mesophotic sites. Settlement surface preference changed with depth, favoring exposed surfaces in mesophotic waters and cryptic surfaces in shallow waters. Juvenile assemblages differed between depths and were distinct from adjacent natural habitats. Over half of the recruited genera overlapped between depths. We suggest that Eilat MCEs serve as a larval sink, providing settlement grounds for shallow-reef propagules. In view of their significance, we call for the protection of these unique and distinct deep-reef habitats.},

Recruitment was clearly shown to vary through time and space, with both depths exhibiting a similar recruitment density for over half of the study period (36 months), but which was eventually higher in the mesophotic reefs (afer 66 months). Tis is also refected in the total cumulative number of new recruits. Te diferences found in recruitment between depths could be a result of several possibilities: (1) a higher number of reproductive species and/or reproductive rates within a given depth; (2) diferential efects of biotic f


n particular, the Pocilloporidae, though preferring shallow depths, was found to be predominant also on the deep tiles. Tis family provides evidence of larval fow from shallow to mesophotic depths. For example, Stylophora had more juveniles in the mesophotic environment (×12) than would be expected based on its abundance in the adult population (Fig. 4c,d). Additionally, Seriatopora was not present in the adult communities at 50m, despite having been found on the settlement tiles at this depth. It is likely that these juveniles’ common origin is from a local larval pool, since these are brooding species, known for recruiting in their local habitat25. Hence, our study’s fndings may indicate that shallow reefs in the GoE/A may be considered as a local larval supply pool for the upper mesophotic reefs.

To test the response to predation, Slattery et al. (2016) transplanted replicate sponges from five depths to a common garden at 10 m (where spongivore densities were high), into caged and uncaged conditions, and reassessed these biochemical characteristics. The mesophotic sponges exposed to predation exhibited a significant increase in defensive metabolites demonstrating phenotypic plasticity in this sponge and the selective pressure of spongivory over the Caribbean basin.

“for zooxanthellate corals in the Gulf of Mexico (GoMx), 72.5\% extend from shallow to mesophotic depths, and only 1.9\% of mesophotic species are restricted to those depths.” (Reaka et al. 2016)

“In the GoMx, 20.3\% of sponge and 23.5\% of polychaete species occur only in MCEs (30–150 m; Reaka et al. 2016). Assemblages of crabs collected from 12, 30, 60, and 90 m in Hawaii differ, with greatest similarity at 30–60 m, suggesting either a transition zone or a specialized mesophotic assemblage (Hurley et al. 2016).”

“Mapping of potential MCE habitats indicates that the northern GoMx (including the Gulf coast of Florida) has over 20 times the potential area of mesophotic habitat than the major Hawaiian Islands and the US Caribbean islands combined (Locker et al. 2010).” Les MCE peuvent exister ou non en fonction de la geomorphologie de la formation récifale. Cela est a prendre en compte dans le role qu’il pourraient jouer ou non en tant que reservoir de biodiversité.

“Species turnover between adjacent depth bands across depth Species turnover for all benthic biota decreased with depth to *130 m, with highest turnover in the shallowest zone (0–20 m; Fig. 3a), smaller peaks at *60 and *110 m, and a sizeable peak at *200 m, which roughly corresponds to the depth of the continental shelf break in the GoMx”

“Although turnover with depth for Crustacea (Fig. 3c) followed the pattern for all combined taxa relatively closely, turnover was higher at *70–100 and 150–190 m than the 95\% CIs for the biota overall. Mollusca (Fig. 3d) followed the pattern for taxa overall quite closely (with small peaks at *60, 110, 200 m), but had slightly lower turnover than the 95\% CIs for overall biota from 0 to 100 m. Echinodermata (Fig. 3d) showed lower turnover than the 95\% CIs for overall biota in many depth zones, and, though a peak was absent at 60 m, small peaks occurred at *140 and 190 m. Foraminifera (Fig. 3c) had lower turnover than the 95\% CIs for overall biota at all depths, although even this group showed very small increases in turnover at *60, 110, 150, and 200 m.”

“Taxonomic overlap between shallow benthos and successively deeper habitats When taxonomic overlap between assemblages in successively deeper habitats was compared to those only in the shallow zone, overlap for all taxa declined with depth approximately following a logistic curve, with the greatest decreases in shared species occurring at the shallowest”

“For crustaceans, species overlap between deeper assemblages and those in shallow water followed the 95\% CIs for all taxa fairly closely over the entire depth range (Fig. 5c). Data for echinoderms and mollusca (Fig. 5d) showed a similar pattern, although slightly elevated above the 95\% CIs for all taxa from shallow water to the continental shelf. Foraminiferans showed much greater overlap with their relatives in shallow water at all depths (Fig. 5c) than the 95\% CIs for all taxa combined, reflecting low values of turnover throughout their depth range (Fig. 3c).” --{\textgreater} Ce resultat permet de considerer sereinement les communautés cryptobenthique a 55/60m comme des communautés caracteristique d’un ecosystème different des recifs peu profonds (si ces resultats avaient montré une courbe à seuil, cela aurait été problemaique).

“We found that this was not necessarily the case for the GoMx, given that species overlap between shallow and successively deeper habitats declined relatively smoothly with depth. While the upper mesophotic zone (*30–60 m) had the strongest potential to serve as a refugium (*30–45\% of total species were shared with shallow habitats), a substantial number (*15–25\%) of total species were shared between midlower mesophotic (60–150 m) and shallow environments. Thus, deeper MCEs have a reduced, but not insignificant, potential to serve as refugia.” --{\textgreater} appart pour les foraminifere (communauté tres homogene dans la depth range

“Globally, coral reefs are increasingly important providers of EGS (Costanza et al., 1997, Costanza et al., 2014). In just two decades, there has been a 44-fold increase in the estimated value of EGS provided by shallow-water coral reefs, increasing from approximately 8000 to 352,000 USD ha−1 year−1 (Costanza et al., 2014; Paoli et al., 2017). Estimating the value of MCEs, both economically and intrinsically (Batavia and Nelson, 2017), is not trivial, particularly in global assessments. While MCEs provide a number of EGS that are also provided by shallow coral ecosystems (e.g., nursery effects and importance for biogeochemical cycles), they also provide distinct EGS (Holstein et al., 2019). For example, MCEs are potential refuges and carbon sinks (Bridge et al., 2013; Loya et al., 2016). In fact, the most neglected ecosystem service provided by mesophotic animal forests is their carbon sink function (Rossi, 2013; Rossi et al., 2017).
MCEs also provide protection from storms and are important potential sources of biotechnological products and fisheries resources (Loya et al., 2016; Holstein et al., 2019). We believe that the range and value of the EGS provided by MCEs justify their protection through the implementation of appropriate policies (Rocha et al., 2018; Soares et al., 2019). Furthermore, we believe that further research must be conducted to understand how the cumulative effect of human stressors affects the EGS provided by MCEs. Only then will we be in a position to discuss the challenges faced by MCEs and define the actions to improve ocean governance in the twilight zone (Baker et al., 2016).”

              Aim
              Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) are unique communities that support a high proportion of depth‐endemic species distinct from shallow‐water coral reefs. However, there is currently little consensus on the boundaries between shallow and mesophotic coral reefs and between upper versus lower MCEs because studies of these communities are often site specific. Here, we examine the ecological evidence for community breaks, defined here as species loss, in fish and benthic taxa between shallow reefs and MCEs globally.
            
            
              Location
              Global MCEs.
            
            
              Time period
              1973–2017.
            
            
              Major taxa studied
              Macrophytes, Porifera, Scleractinia, Hydrozoa, Octocorallia, Antipatharia and teleost fishes.
            
            
              Methods
              We used random‐effects models and breakpoint analyses on presence/absence data to identify regions of higher than expected species loss along a depth gradient of 1–69 m, based on a meta‐analysis of 26 studies spanning diverse photoautotrophic and heterotrophic taxa. We then investigated the extent to which points of high faunal turnover can be explained by environmental factors, including light, temperature and nutrient availability.
            
            
              Results
              We found evidence for a community break, indicated by a significant loss of shallow‐water taxa, at {\textasciitilde} 60 m across several taxonomically and functionally diverse benthic groups and geographical regions. The breakpoint in benthic composition is best explained by decreasing light, which is correlated with the optical depths between 10 and 1\% of surface irradiance. A concurrent shift in the availability of nutrients, both dissolved and particulate organic matter, and a shift from photoautotroph to heterotroph‐dominated assemblages also occurs at {\textasciitilde} 60 m depth.
            
            
              Main conclusions
              We found evidence for global community breaks across multiple benthic taxa at {\textasciitilde} 60 m depth, indicative of distinct community transitions between shallow and mesophotic coral ecosystems. Changes in the underwater light environment and the availability of trophic resources along the depth gradient are the most parsimonious explanations for the observed patterns.},

These reefs exhibit a demarcation between shallow and mesophotic communities and between upper mesophotic and lower mesophotic communities (Lesser et al., 2018; Slattery \& Lesser, 2019). There is less evidence for similar community breaks at {\textasciitilde} 60 m from the larger and more diverse Indo-Pacific, but the available data also support the existence of a community break between the upper and lower mesophotic in this region (Bridge et al., 2011, 2012; Slattery \& Lesser, 2012). “

Locations where long-term data do exist, including Palau and the U.S. Virgin Islands, provide valuable insights into environmental processes affecting MCEs that can help to guide monitoring, research and management programs.”
“s. For example, from long-term datasets we have now learned that MCEs are not protected from all threats, and that oceanographic processes are perhaps more important than depth in terms of buffering corals from the impact of thermal stress (Neal et al. 2014, Nir et al. 2014)”

“Consequently, as observed in the U.S. Virgin Islands (Smith et al. 2015), mesophotic corals may exhibit lower bleaching thresholds than corals in shallower habitats.”
“Water velocities from storm waves (maximum orbital velocities) decline exponentially with depth, and MCEs are therefore afforded some protection from hydrodynamic disturbances (e.g. Woodley et al. 1981). However, organisms living in the upper mesophotic zone (30–50 m) may experience direct impacts from storms (White et al. 2013). Indirect effects of storms, such as debris avalanches, can affect MCEs (Harmelin-Vivien and Laboute 1986), while very severe storms can damage reefs to depths of at least 70 m (Bongaerts et al. 2013a). The typical plating and foliose morphologies of many mesophotic coral species leave them prone to degradation following physical disturbance.”
“Data on connectivity between shallow and mesophotic reefs is limited (Bongaerts et al. 2010a, Kahng et al. 2014).”
